# Learning_Notes
All notes I took in Obsidian studying a wide variety of topics, with a major focus on Machine Learning, Data Science, and computer-related subjects. “Study hard what interests you most, in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible.” :D

Inside each folder there is a .md file.

Text files created with Markdown language dialects is saved with .md or .MARKDOWN file extension. MD files are saved in plain text format that uses Markdown language which also includes inline text symbols, defining how a text can be formatted such as indentations, table formatting, fonts, and headers.

These repository have all the learning note that i take on my Obsidian application.

Enjoy them :D
